    <H2>To his his sister Mary Capell</H2>

    <P class=salutation>My Dear Mary</P>
    
<P>This is like living at a lighthouse! &ndash; cut off from the world all
day, with the incessant sound of heavy seas.</P>

<P>I have had a good letter from Mother.  Please thank her.  After all I
am not in such need of pants, as I have retrieved a pair I left last June
in charge of Mme. Boutir at Noeux!  (Trottie got them for me).  Rats &
insect life are the bane of this place, but we really are not having a bad
time.  Willett has been recalled. Roffe is still here, otherwise it is a
new party of men, with me & a sergeant as N.C.O.s.  A different officer too
&ndash; Capt Coleman, otherwise "Natty", otherwise "Juliet". A very tall,
gaunt, dark, lantern-jawed, shortsighted man, &ndash; in civil life a
renowned dentist; an awfully decent sort, but extraordinarily naif.  His
high-pitched voice, so out of keeping with his appearance, & his mannerism
of saying "Roight!" (for "right") have long been pet features of the
Ambulance.</P>

<P>The village is heavily straffed every day &ndash; quite severely
yesterday & today in particular.  Yesterday the trench outside was smashed
in, but we have perfect confidence in our cellars.  In spare moments I am
reading Voltaire's correspondence with the King of Prussia, which Berthe
Tiry sent me.  I have had a letter from Miss Maynam from a hospital ship at
Lemnos.</P>

<P>What a miracle, that evacuation of Gallipoli!  Fortunate for us that all
our enemies are not so wily as the Germans. &ndash; Some of our fellows are
rather depressed by the Germans.  "They are all on top of us in everything
but courage", one wounded man said to me.</P>

<P>I have extraordinarily little to say: what I could say &ndash;
descriptions of the scenes around, details of the day's bombardment & of
the casualties &ndash; are just what wouldn't be the thing to give.</P>

<P>Tell Frank that I have had a tin of cheroots from J.J. Hart.</P>

<P>My love to you all.  Richard</P>
