    <H2>To his sister Mary Capell</H2>

    <P class=salutation>My dear Mary:</P>

<P>If I have been remiss in not writing, put it down to my occupations
&ndash; I have spent all my spare time in baling out my dug-out & in efforts
at repairing its roof.  How disappointing are these deferred promises of
spring!  One day brings a delicious hour or two, & the next torrents of rain
&ndash; if not snow.  Half the dug-outs in this village of dug-outs are
flooded &ndash; five or six feet deep, often.  The habitable ones want
looking after every day.  Of course there is not a roof intact within
unless the difference between this place & the next is that here there is
an occasional wall standing, & also the majestic ruin of a church, while
<em>there</em> is nothing but a rubbish heap.  Our village is traversed by line after
line of old trenches, & there are shell-holes by the ten thousand.  On the
hills are scattered the bones of hundreds & thousands of the unburied dead.  By
chance I saw yesterday in an old trench human leg-bones in a pair of German
boots.  The sight of this valley! &ndash; &ndash; It gives Armageddon a
spectacular look that it hasn't in the flat country northwards.  You can
see for such distances, too.  It is amazing & tremendous that the French
managed to take this ground.

<P>My dug-out is German-built, & there are plenty of German inscriptions to
be read here & there.  Really the worst of the place is the rats &ndash;
that swarm both indoors & out.  After dark you tread among them, & they
squeak like birds wherever you go.  I foresee the time when the enfeebled
British & German forces will have to combine against the rat peril. &ndash;
Save for a little perfunctory artillery fire, (they scatter shrapnel over
us once or twice a day &ndash; quite harmless), the front is quiet, but
from what I have seen I have a faint idea of the inferno that this place
once was.  The little German cemeteries here had their crosses riddled or
blown away, & sometimes whole graves too, by their own shell-fire.

<P>How sorry I am that Mother has had such a bad touch of influ! &ndash;
Thank you much, my dear, for your letter; and I hope you get a bit of a
holiday.  The parcels are much appreciated.  I will write to Marge.  Voi
gets a place of honour now on all the B.E.A. maps!  I can't help feeling
decidedly anxious about Grandfather.  How I hope the fine weather hastens
to put in an appearance.  There are actually a few daffodils out in our
back-garden; gooseberry bushes too seem to escape the shells in some
numbers.  The orchard trees are mostly killed if not actually cut to the
ground.

<P>Goodbye, my dear.  Believe me that I am well & cheerful.  Your Richard

<P>It is possible that when we are back in reserve I may be able to call on
the Tiry's again.
