    <H2>To his sister Mary Capell</H2>

    <P class=salutation>My dear Mary:</P>
    
<P>It is more than good of you to write so often.  All the little scraps of
home news are interesting.

<P>On one or two days of late spring has tried to put in an appearance; but
how horrible March is, on the whole!  It has been snowing again; yest'y &
today, & is very cold.  Good news! &ndash; that my teeth are once more in going
order.  I have had a three days' doing at a Casualty Station &ndash;
managed to get permission to walk over to the nearest one, (we being for
the moment so far back); so that I got it all over without the fuss of
being "evacuated".

<P>These "Casualty Stations" are the link between the Fd Ambulance & the
hospital train, stationary hospital, etc.  They are mostly established in
tents, & the goings-on are very much like a Fd Amb. headquarters but on a
bigger scale.  Being stationary, they can arrange for more complicated
operations than we; & the patients are supposed to be better fed, &ndash;
at all events, better food is allotted them: some-one gets it!  Our old
"SM" is Q.M.S. at one of these places not far off.  One of the corporals
visited him the other day &ndash; found his stores like a going grocery-shop &
himself ensconced among cases of whisky & stout.  The corporal came back
loaded up with bottled fruits, sauces, etc. for our mess...

<P>The dentist at No. 18 where I have been has stopped two of my front
teeth, & now I fear nothing in the way of hot or cold or sweet or sour
things. &ndash; A very clever fellow, I think, & he was considerate & not
"regimental", so my fears were unfounded.

<P>Our stay here has been shorter than we thought for, & also broken by the
eight days "trek".  Also quite a large number of the men, 50 or so, are
detached, &ndash; doing forestry work! some miles away.

<P>Yesterday I had another parcel from Auntie L., &ndash; I am feeling
quite spoilt.  Anyhow we had a tea-party on the strength of it.  Most
excellent, everything therein! &ndash; I will write to her direct shortly.

<P>I owe thanks to Harold for his letter. &ndash; When shall I have a
glimpse of you all again? &ndash; How curious it seems to hear of Tony
talking!  I can't think of him as anything but a fat & inarticulate baby.
I suppose he will be in knickers if not trousers before I see him!

<P>My dear, to think that this month I shall be 31!  In times of peace I
should think this tragic, but after all the youth I have seen extinguished
at one swoop it seems quite a lot to possess even a vital spark approaching
middle-age! &ndash; This of course is bosh, as I don't feel in the least
like middle-age.  By the way I told the army people, by misadventure, 18
months ago, that I was a year younger than I really am & I have had to
stick to this fiction since!

<P>I have been reading the notice on Henry James in the <em>M.Guardian</em>
&ndash; the best thing of its sort I have ever seen.  Thought of Mother
reading "The Wings of the Dove"; &ndash; & of Auntie A. with "The Golden
Bowl"!

<P>Lord N.<sup><a href="#F1" name="R1">1</a></sup> at Verdun! &ndash; I
wonder how much of his message was his own?  It was competent, I thought,
if undistinguished. &ndash;  &ndash; 

<P>Goodbye, my dear.  My love to you all!  I am very glad if you manage to
get a little gaiety out of things.  Richard
