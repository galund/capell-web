    <P class=salutation>Dearest Mother:</P>
    
<P>Fresh fields & pastures new. &ndash; &ndash;  Only the other day I was longing for a change
of scene.  We have it.  Hills & vales, (all covered this week in unmelting snow); real villages,
 no longer those little mining towns.  This place is really picturesque, for instance.  We came
 in two stages, & on the evening of the first day I saw the Tiry's [at Bruay], &ndash; had
 dinner with them, in fact.  Berthe is back from Paris, invalided with anaemia.  M. Flamme
 (the uncle) has been called up for the army.  Aged over 40 & never having done any service
 before, owing to a deformed foot, he is feeling the new conditions pretty acutely.  Trottie
 went with me, & we had a very jolly time.  Both Mme. Tiry & Mme. Flamme are charming &ndash;
 they couldn't be kinder.  What a queer coincidence that we should be among the first English
 troops to go there!  (Previously when I had been to see them it had been an unofficial journey).

<P>There, & also at this village I have been billetting, under Capt. Dixon &ndash; coming on by car,
each time, a few hours ahead of the troops & having countless experiences, amusing sometimes &
sometimes tedious. &ndash; On the whole it has not been at all bad fun, though it has been
really tremendous labour to get all things settled down: hardly more than three or four modern
houses, the rest are ramshackle old farm-buildings.  It is all more uncomfortable than any
place we have been to, save the very first village [St Hilaire] of all, last March, but the
only people to have "groused" have been the sergeants, who have been rather pampered in the
past.  The men have settled down well.

<P>The people here have never had English troops before &ndash; or rather only for a day or two
quite early in the War.  They are different from the mining people, &ndash; slow-witted, but
very friendly for the most part: (this is just a first impression).  I should have said that we
are quite a long way from the front &ndash; at the back of the war zone, in fact.  Where we go
& what we do when our "rest" period is over remains to be seen.  The change of scene & air will
do everyone good, &ndash; we were getting stale & stuffy.

<P>I am biletted in a farm-stable with Roffe, Willett, Caldicott & one other &ndash; a little
rabbit-hutch of a place, which has this advantage of protecting us by night from the bitter
north-east, snow-laden winds.  Plenty of straw.  One little drawback &ndash; the rats. &ndash;
They swarm!  But you can get used to rats walking about you, &ndash; so long as they don't get
in the bed-clothes.  One fell down from the roof on me last night & I woke everyone with a
piercing yell uttered in half sleep. &ndash; Roffe is well.  Willett has a bad cold, &
Caldicott is just out of hospital; &ndash; influenza.

<P>Yesterday I had a wonderful heap of letters &ndash; a little accumulation.  Thank you for
your fine letter. &ndash; The reason I was so long silent was that, setting off for the
"manoeuvres", I anticipated long marches & a return in three days, so left everything possible
behind me, including notepaper.  I am sorry for the dismal tone of my last letter!  Just a
passing mood! &ndash; Not but what I am convinced that there is something wrong with England.
What for instance are they doing for all the middle-class men who come out here & have to
continue with rents & rates? &ndash; The landlords go on claiming their pound of flesh, I
suppose, though if it weren't for the men here, all their property might be nothing but a heap
of smashed bricks. &ndash; Not a man in this place but grandfathers!  The women on the farms
work like Trojans.

<P>This in summer would be a most delightful spot.  Today has arrived Isabel's splendid parcel.
 All my thanks.  I haven't had time to open it yet.  You've no idea of the various little jobs
 that I am called on for!  Misunderstandings crop up that I have to solve, & even those of our
 men who can talk French won't take the trouble to put on the suavity which is rather necessary
 to get along well with the people.  A little graciousness & an urbane turn of phrase, & all,
 as a rule, is well! &ndash; More later!  Your Richard
