    <H2>To his sister Margaret Layzell</H2>

    <P class=date>11th Jan [1916]</P>
    <P class=place>6th Lon.Fd.Amb. 47th Division</P>
    <P class=salutation>Dear Marge:</P>
    
<P>I am a brute not to write to you oftener.  You & Stanley are often in my
mind, I assure you, & I seize on the scanty scraps of news from B.E.A.
&ndash; It really looks as if something decisive were to be done your way.</P>

<P>As for anything decisive here, &ndash; how expect it, then three great
efforts &ndash; Neuve Chapelle, Festubert, Loos (I have seen the last two
with my own eyes) &ndash; have failed to break the German defensive!  But
I won't discuss the war, &ndash; I really don't understand it a bit!
Still I am glad the Loos casualties &ndash; 60,000 &ndash; have been
published. &ndash; (Quite one of the bloodiest battles in history, I
suppose).  So many people at home still don't seem to grasp what it means:
such figures must leur donnent furieusement a penser, you would think!</P>

<P>The home people are splendid in writing, & I have just got your Christmas
 letter.  It is one of the curiosities of this business that tho'
 (as we do at this moment) you live like a troglodyte in dug-outs &
 trenches, & are practically cut off from the outside world during hours of
 light, your post arrives with up-to-date regularity.  We are at the moment
 manning an aid-post in the cellars of a farm &ndash; that was &ndash; in a
 famous village.  Quite a romantic spot!  You can't put your nose round the
 corner by day.  If you want a "constitutional", you have to resort to the
 trenches, where you are sheltered &ndash; but the scenery is so limited!</P>

<P>No, I have not had leave yet, & shall no doubt have to wait long for
it:&ndash; not a quarter of the fellows have been yet, & I have met men who
have been out longer than we, who have not yet been.  People at home don't
understand that this "leave" question is not a right but a favour.
Officers of course get it frequently, however.</P>

<P>Here we do what work there is by night.  I have just been trying to read
I. Hamilton's Suvla Bay despatch &ndash; but it is too heart-rending, so I
turn to a frivolous French novel that the officer in charge has passed on to
 me.  You know all that I do about home affairs, (it is more than a year
 since I was home, & ten months since I saw them all).</P>

<P>Goodbye, my dear!  Cheer up & give my love to Stanley.  I am well &ndash; my nerves in good order, never better.  Thy Richard
