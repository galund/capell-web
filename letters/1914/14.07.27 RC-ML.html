<H2>To his sister Margaret Layzell (in East Africa)</H2>

<P class=salutation>Dearest Marge–</P>
<P>Need it be said that we have thought of you these days?  Thought, but not spoken: a banned topic.  Since there was nothing to be said but futile & irritating presumptions...  But to say that all of us were without criticisms of the lack of two or three more explanatory words in that tel[e]g[ram] of three weeks ago would be less than strict fact!  Never mind: there will doubtless be a word tomorrow or the day after.  I might have waited writing till then, but tomorrow I am off on holiday; so seize this opportunity.  We are counting of letters of extraordinary interest from B.E.A., within the next few weeks!  I was at home the other week-end.  These days there has been a kaleidoscope-shift.  Mary & Tony went to South View on Fri.  Isa. & F[rank]. went to Gt. Billing today.  Young <a href="4.7.html#Emile">Emile</a>  is at home & Alex is ab[ou]t to set off for France.  Fraser too, I think.  At home I admired the new dining room: sky & a glimpse of green at both ends!...  The drawing-room, etc., were still chaotic.  The boys looked well & flourishing.  Fraser is a young animal full of interest, – I keep comparing him (as far as I know him) with myself at the same age (a still more unbearable creature):  there is so much in common as is inevitable in things of the same race: not much more.  Evans  seems to look to his new career with placidity.  Harold is looking forward to fishing with F[ran]k.</P>
 
<P>And F[ran]k himself! – I went down three or four times to Amersham.  Things there went along well.  The K's were <U>charmingly kind</U>  to Isa. all along, and they relieved (Daisy particularly) the almost unbearable strain of being with F[ran]k.  Today they left, as the K's are off to the seaside.  I met them at Mary'bone, went to the Dr's, lunched at Euston & saw them off by the 2.45.  F[ran]k is far stronger & considerably better than when he left hospital.  He cannot however talk any more, and he has fits of moodiness, bad-temper etc. which are very trying.  He is so far himself in many ways that the intrusion of this <U>some-one else</U>, so to speak – a stupid, selfish, boyish some-one else –, is disconcerting.  I can't think how Isa. keeps up to the strain of always being with him.  One has to jump like a flea to follow his thoughts from the few words he gets on paper.  He thinks a great deal ab[ou]t a dog that Cliff R. has given him.  He is quite <U>all there</U> on most things you talk to him ab[ou]t, but thinks little or not at all on things which are out of his sight. – Fortunately, for Mrs Hewitt has been awfully ill; & there have been scrums at the office. –</P>

<P>Tomorrow I am going to Scotland.  I feel stale & want something different in the way of scene & air.  I am going by boat from London to Grangemouth (near Edinboro').  The rest is all vague: I shall wander as chance wills & spend a week or so at N'pton at the end of August.  The Russian season came to an end in a blaze of glory on Sat. –</P>

<P>Dare I trust myself to talk ab[ou]t the Briggs'?  My last illusions, (they lingered an unconscionably long time), ab[ou]t those people have all gone.  For long I put much blame on Isa. herself even.  The fact is, in my simple-mindedness, I <U>could</U> not credit such odious falsity, malice and stupid jealousy in people I had liked.  Even now it is hardly believable, but the evidence has accumulated so, lately, that my complacent spirit has boiled with rage.  For their spite towards Isabel they have gone to inconceivable lengths in the way of malicious gossip etc.  Mrs K. said she would never have had Isa. in her house if she had believed things they told her.  I went to see Mrs. H. last week – a formal visit (she was very ill); and she wrote to me asking me to go another day for a chat.  No doubt she thinks she may die any week or month now, & to look at her one can think so too, poor dear.  But even in extremity she is clever & spirited, & knows how to take advantage of her helplessness, so that of course one never has a chance to "get one back"!  Katherine's spite & Ted's hysteria, – but I won't go on.  How could one conceive their attempts to upset things (during three years) between F[ran]k & Is!  No doubt, too, they are largely responsible for the Layzells' attitude towards you; and I suppose you have heard that they have even attempted to colour Gordon's feelings to us?! –</P>

<P>Edith kept me an hour the other afternoon talking of her holiday plans (she is going to Varengeville), & about Canada (she is still cafuetting with poor Canada).  Her egoism is insufferable & nauseating.  Dot., you may have heard, has had her appendix out & is getting better.  Katherine's kiddies have wh[ooping] cough, & Charles, who has most of the work at the D.M. to do, is incredibly bearish at home, so they say.  I never speak to him at the office, – daren't!  This is not cheerful but it will amuse you.  I can't talk abt you yourself, as I don't know where you are and whether or no you are Miss C. or Mrs L...</P>

<P>Jo & Gordon seem to get on well.  Their house is in a pretty street, & conveniently near the tube.  Jo looked rather yellow last time I saw her but was in good spirits.  I have had one or two enlivening days – a long interview with the great Chaliapin, a lunch at the Capel Cure's with some of the Russians, & a party the other afternoon at 10, Downing St.  Our weather is cool & showery: I shd dearly like to know how Jones is.  How interesting it will be, too, to hear if 18 months in the wilds has or hasn't changed Stanley out of all recognition!  At home all seemed well, save Miss E. who, I thought, looked almost decrepit.  When will this reach you? – I really must get to learn something ab[ou]t mails etc.  Well, my dear, (Miss or Mrs), best loving greetings  Richard</P>
