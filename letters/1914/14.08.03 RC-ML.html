<H2>To his sister Margaret Layzell (in East Africa)</H2>
<P class=date>[Monday]    Aug. 3 (1914)</P>
<P class=place>Maitland Temperance Hotel, 33 Shandwick Place
Edinburgh</P>
<P class=salutation>Dear Margaret:-</P>
<P>[We are anxiously awaiting tomorrow's mail news ab[ou]t you.  I suppose you two do realise what we have been feeling at being with[ou]t a notion of your doings these three weeks!..]</p>

<p>I came here from London (by sea) last week, & am thinking of going on to Oban, or somewhere there.  But these days there seems only one thing to think about. – this European nightmare, (– only if it is a reality), of general war.  Who could have believed that such madness would have fallen on everyone?  Until the last moment it seemed that something must avert such a cataclysm.  What will be the end of it?  Special editions of the papers were coming out all day yesterday (Sunday) in Edinburgh.  And you two – why, I suppose it would take some weeks for the news of London sacked by Germans to reach you!  The excitement & the anxiety here are tremendous. – All home news you will have had.  Edinburgh is a noble-looking city, & I am enjoying a prowl round new territory.</p>
<p>  Affectionately  Richard</p>
