    <P class=salutation>My dear</P>
<P>A word of thanks for your letter.  I am well; the weather is springlike,
& we are not unduly "straffed".</P>

<P>A fresh lot of men here, save for Roffe & myself.  Officer:
Capt Dickinson, "one of the best", &ndash; in fact the best.  As sergeant,
&ndash; the decent little busman chap who was away with me just before
Christmas.</P>

<P>I <em>insist</em> on having the Raemaeckers cartoons!  Thanks for the
"Spectator".  But the "Saturday Review" makes me <em>ill</em>.  I would as soon be a
German as an Englishman of the "Saturday Review" sort.  How flattering to
Generals & suchlike big-wigs, the dogma that out here all is self-sacrifice
& efficiency as opposed to the self-seeking of politicians! &ndash; &ndash;
Really the English military big-wig is as bad as the German, (& not so
learned).  The reason I intend sticking here as long as I can is that at
H.Q.s life is unendurable because of the endless "cleaning up" fatigues
&ndash; spotless uniforms (no matter what dirty job you have been on),
"kits" geometrically arranged in long rows with scrupulous uniformity, &
squads of men engaged incessantly in picking up match-ends etc. in the
hospital precincts! &ndash; &ndash; Life here is a relative holiday, despite the
incessant clatter of the bombardment.  Really our unit has never been so
fussy; & this, despite our happy relief from the old C.O. & s.m. &ndash;
The reason seems to be that the hospital is next door to the A.D.M.S. (if
you know who he is!), &ndash; & next door but one to the general.</P>

<P>The socks in the parcel are fine: likewise the pants, which are really
better than the silk ones, which get torn to shreds.  It is a luxury to
have a nice new pair of puttees, too.  I will write to Aunt Carrie.</P>

<P>I much appreciated a long letter I had from Uncle Evans.</P>

<P>Goodbye, my dear.  Put a pot of anchovy paste in, when you are sending
me something, will you? (but don't send me another parcel for a long time
yet). Your Richard</P>
