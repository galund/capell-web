    <P class=salutation>My dear Mary:</P>

<P>I am awfully glad you have had a holiday, & was much interested in
hearing of your doings.  Jo says you are deep in Balzac.  Ages since I read
any Balzac, but how enthralled I was:&ndash; "Lost Illusions" & the rest.
Why don't you try him in French?  I don't know how I should like him now.
Nearly everything I used to admire seems now colourless & thin.  What shall
we read after the war?  I think we shall want something harsher, more
genuine than the old stuff.  Even Shelley & Browning have lately seemed to
have weaknesses I usen't to see.

<P>Rain, rain, here.  Every day, &ndash; not all day of course, but the general
impression is wet, & the poor trench-men come back in a lamentable state.
The other evening Trottie & I went up to our "ridge" to look at the
shelling. &ndash; A wondrous clear evening; and the sight of that unimaginable
battlefield never fails to enthrall me.  I could tell you thrilling tales
of the little affair hereabouts of the other night, but this is not the
moment, my dear. &ndash; I think nothing in the whole history of things &ndash; Greeks
in wooden horses & Joshua bringing down city's walls with trumpets &ndash; has
been more adventurous & romantic than some of these little affairs.

<P>I have had letters from Auntie L. & Isabel &ndash; best thanks for the
snapshots: some of them are really precious!  Certainly I want to keep
them.  I think that some of the pictures of the dear Mother are better than
any I have seen of her.  Josie's aren't quite so successful.  I am not
quite clear about James Evans' occupation.  I wrote a line to him the
other day, & hope he will keep up his pecker.  One thing &ndash; the whole
business must surely be over before he is called on to see the real
thing.

<P>Goodbye, my dear, I am leading a dull & quite undistinguished life.
Roffe is on hospital duty, & Willett is "up the line".  My love to the
dear Mother.  Richard

<P>[The next day the battle of the Somme began.]
