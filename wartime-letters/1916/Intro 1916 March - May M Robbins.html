<P>It is difficult to identify exactly where the letters of the next two months were
written.  The HQ of the Ambulance was at Gouay Servins, 15 km s of Bethune, from
14 March to 24 April.  This village lies about 8 km w of Souchez, Ablain St Nazaire, and
Cabaret Rouges, then places more to the Bethune-Arras overlooked from the east by Vimy ridge, still then 
 in German hands and from the west by the spire of Notre Dame de Lorette - important
 tactical features both; of the latter, "beyond redress that victory in every war will
 fall to the conqueror of this section of hills" according to <i>The Blue Hills:
 North-Eastern France</i> (1930), 54/  It had been captured by the French in a savage
 and expensive battle (south of Souchez) in May 1915; hence the references to
 former labours XXX
 The British took over this part of the line in March 1916.
 RC wrote from forward posts in this area, which is here simply but vaguely called
 "N.D. or Lorette".
