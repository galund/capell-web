    <P class=salutation>Dearest Mother:</P>

	<P>Respite

<P>The last party of us came back first thing this morning (Roffe & Willett among us, of
course).  A hard night, but a successful one (unlike one or two previous nights).

<P>I don't intend trying to give you an account of our doings.  The great distances (we have
been almost to the furthest point of the advance) &ndash; and, most, the appalling weather
have made this last affair the stiffest we have ever been in.  My impressions are confused.
The magnitude of the business simply baffles the imagination: this makes it all different from
previous affairs.<sup><a href="#F1" name="R1">1</a></sup> 

<P>There has been a lot of muddling on our part &ndash; (at times we, frankly, lost all
confidence in our leaders & chiefs): but sheer hard work has retrieved much.

<P>About our infantry: I daren't say a word.  Tragic glory! &ndash;

<P>Through being sick I missed the first day or two.  I am now well; nothing at all wrong but
an enormous indolence!  Yesterday the sun shone, & improved the ground.  It had been a morass.
Five of us on a stretcher were at one moment stuck in mud helplessly, & had to be dragged out.
I have fallen over in mud fifty times.

<P>I have had heaps of kind letters &ndash; Alex's today.  It would be nicer if I were
<em>really brave</em>; which I am not!

<P>Tell Auntie L. that in spite of everything I made the most of her parcel.

<P>Caldicott is in hospital at Etaples, quite all right & cheery.  We mourn the death of L/C
Holdom &ndash; <em>one of the best</em>.  No-one in the Amb. had done better, &ndash; all along.  Our
wounded are all slight cases.

<P>Thank Mrs Pettit for letter, Auntie A. too.  I haven't the energy to write much at the
moment.  This indolence is too luxurious!

<P>My love to Frank & Isabel.  I did not see the D.M. of Monday &ndash; haven't seen a paper
for a week, as a matter of fact.

<P>Roffe & Willett have done finely.  Alas! this <em>medal business</em> is a stupidity.  We have had
six in the unit &ndash; four R.A.M.C. & two "attached" men.  Dean & I have just done what
there was to do on different occasions (nothing out of the way).  For the others: &ndash; but
who am I to talk?

<P>I am just off to a hand at Auction: &ndash; prize anodyne!  My tenderest love  Richard

involved in the renewed attack on the Somme front, from Bazentin towards
High Wood and Flers.  Richard must have rejoined them two or three days
later.</div>
