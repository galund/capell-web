    <P class=place>6th Lon. Fd. Amb.   [Millercourt<sup><a href="#F1" name="R1">1</a></sup>]</P>
    <P class=salutation>Dearest Mother:</P>

<P>A change! &ndash; I am in a party detached temporarily to work with another F.A.  Imagine a
collection of tents, little & big, on the crest of one of the characteristic "Downs"
you have read of: &ndash; all wind-swept & bare of trees.  Not a house for miles.  The tents
all gaudy with Futurist colourings &ndash; anti-aircraft!  We are a long way still from the
firing line, tho' one can see on a distant crest a series of explosions perpetually -
the Furnace. &ndash; &ndash;  Occasionally a shell lands in an unfortunate little town in the dip
below us.

<P>It is wet, windy weather.  We are sleeping in tents, but on sodden ground & without
a blanket this is chilly enough.  We are under the rule of an alien sergeant-major, &
"fatigues" early & late are the rule.  Ancient wire entanglements line the camp & one
has the impression of being an interned alien.  Certainly the German prisoners that we
saw the other day do just the same work & live the same as we today!  And after living
so long together & then suddenly pushed into strange company we have just the
impression of being with foreigners.

<P>If this lasts long the tedium will be extreme.  Nothing to read!  The semi-starvation
of army rations unsupplemented! &ndash; &ndash;  Bridge must be our resource.  How long our stay
at this Ruhleben will be I haven't an idea.  I had your letter, thank you, my dear.
But a lot of my papers, etc. seem to have "gone west".  I am rejoiced at being free of
the Q.M. stores.  The Q.M. was an impossible outsider, & the Q.M.S. quite, quite
mad. &ndash; &ndash;   Ever your Richard
