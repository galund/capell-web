    <P class=salutation>Dearest old Marge:</P>

<P>A first word of greeting.  I suppose you get news of me from home.
The last I heard of you was that you were well on Oct 15 & that Stanley was
at Dar-es-Salaam.  Good luck to you both & may you not be tempted to come
back to this detestable continent till all is over.  I have written to you
shamefully little, but my thoughts go often youwards & I never miss a
B.E.A. &ndash; or rather <em>G.E.A.</em> paragraph in the papers.  Of course we are rather
expecting soon to see that the Bosch has had a coup de grace in <em>that</em> region
anyhow; but we are old & wise now here & not over-sanguinely expectant
about anything. &ndash; I am well; though I had a spell in hospital some three
weeks ago with (I think) lumbago.  At the moment I am at a Dressing Station
near the trenches.  Things are fairly quiet.  The place is marshy, & we
live in a hole in an old railway embankment.  Wet weather gives me twinges
in joints & muscles that I knew of never before!  but after all that is a
small penalty.

<P>I have had lively accounts from home of the visit of your Pathan
friend &ndash; who made a sensation second only to Count Fleury's famous
week-end in our modest abode.  Mary has had a holiday in London with Jo, &
has been good in writing to me.  We are as voracious for letters here as
you, I guess.  When things are quiet the post is wonderfully regular.  Your
letters come up daily with the rations; likewise newspapers, &ndash; yesty's
London papers arrive here today.  The combination of civilisation &
savagery in this most desolate scene is curious. &ndash; Every house bashed out
of recognition (some of them are mere heaps of rubble with grass growing
over); acres of rough cemeteries; trees lopped by shell-fire.  But there is
electric light in some dug-outs.  Telephone communication all over the place
 of course.

<P>We are a small party here, & our work is chiefly done at night: &ndash; by day
you look over the countryside without seeing a trace of a living thing.
Looking back a year (we were at Loos then), I remember we thought it
impossible that things could go on like this till now.  And <em>two</em> years
ago! &ndash; Anyhow we resign ourselves, & feel grateful for the comparative
respite of a quiet part of the line.  You will have heard that we had a
stiff time in the Somme in Sept. & Oct.

<P>Goodbye, my dear girl.  My greetings to Stanley.  Richard
