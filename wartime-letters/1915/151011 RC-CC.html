    <H2>To his mother Charlotte Capell</H2>

    <P class=place>[?]</P>
    <P class=salutation>Dearest Mother:</P>
<P>A word from among the ruins.  Quite a large party of us here; but not, I believe, for long.  We should be quite all right, if it weren't for a certain sergeant.  Ah, cursed fate that I should be in the power of so unutterably common, brutish a creature!..</P>

<P>We are just beyond the civilised (inhabited) zone, but not in the most desperate sort of ruins.  The whole place is shaking at this moment with the bombardment.  I will tell you more about things later.  This little note is simply to tell you that I am well & cheerful.  By the way, did you see that George Monteith (Isa & Frank will know whom I mean, - my friend of St George's Road days) - has been killed?  A bright soul...</P>

<P>A dull, rainy morning; but the afternoon promises to be bright.  I have been on a  exploring party, looking in abandoned houses for chairs, pails & anything that may be useful for the dressing station.</P>

<P>The bombardment shakes the house so that it is difficult to write upstairs.  Willett has just made up the tin of "cafe au lait" that came in Marge's parcel - having stolen hot water from the "Primus" in the Dressing-room.</P>

<P>There seems to be no end of field-ambulances hereabouts (many of them "Kitchener" units), so pretty well everything will be done that can be done in the "circs".</P>

<P>Ever much love from your Richard</P>
