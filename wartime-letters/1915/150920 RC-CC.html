    <P class=salutation>Dearest Mother:</P>

    <P>I shall have much, one day, to tell you about these times – Enough for the moment that a party of us are installed in the "citta morta" – very few as yet, (Roffe, Willett, myself & another came up with medical stores yest'y at midnight, by blazing September moonlight).  This is a life all among the ruins, in cellars & trenches.  Monstrous music of the great guns by night & day...  Today more glorious September weather; but the night "in cellar cool" was bitter.  Quite a lot of strenuous preparatory work.  We are quite close to the fire-trenches – nearer than we have had a Dressing-Station before.  The scene is amazingly romantic:– we are going to have a change from the harness-polishing & vanities of recent weeks! </P><P>Ever my fond love.  Richard</P>
