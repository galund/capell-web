<P class=salutation>My dearest old Marge-:</P>
<P>Just a week since you left these lonely islands!  You can't imagine how we have been dying to catch a glimpse of you in that Llanstephan Hotel.  We must possess our souls in patience.  I suppose there will be some sort of word of you in a day or two.  After the L. Cast. vanished into the Solent (we saw the last of her) Mother had a little weep & we went off to explore South'pton.  Isa: Mary & I came back to London (Russian ballet), – Mother & Father coming on next day.  Mother has gone home tonight.  I just missed saying goodbye to her by the 7 o'cl.  What another world all these doings will seem to thee!  Since then, Mary and the Balls have been with me at the Ballet (a box!) ...  What oo & don't you know? ...</p>

<p>Frank is getting better so fast that ultimate recovery is assured of  (speech etc.).  At the moment it all remains frightfully trying for Isa:, especially visits.  He can't talk, poor dear, & is painfully conscious of his deficiencies.  He has been in the park (Bridgwater's motor) & enjoys it.  Visitors excite him too much, but he has crowds now.  Isa tonight was very done up, - but in a week or so they will be off & away from minor importunities.  If you see him, the first thing that strikes you is, after all, that he is himself – and remembering five weeks ago! ...</p>

<p>Meanwhile you can guess my life. – The three Olympian doctors went to the ballet with me on Tuesday, (Williams, Pearson & Brown)! ...  A successful party. – Another night Ashmead, Bartlett & the Capel Cures.  First nights galore ...  But this is all padding.  The interesting thing is that when you get this you will be Mrs Layzell – at least, I suppose so, – Mary says so, – tho' I think it queer you shouldn't stop to open your letters first ...  Good luck ...  The more the days go on the more I wish I had a holiday – & had gone with you ...  But I sh[oul]d  have wanted more books than you, poor child, seemed to have.  As it is, my life is impossibly full.  I felt so burdened with ennui that I went to Southsea last Sunday for sea air – then had to sit in a shelter all the time because of a tropical thunderstorm (tropical, – ahem!).  Farewell, my child.  This is futile scribble.  But all the time one wants to ask questions, – which would be futiler still.</p>

<p>Greetings to the bridegroom.  Richard</p>
