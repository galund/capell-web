    <P class=salutation> My dear Marge:-</P>

<p>I hear you are having a spree at Bedf[or]d.  On the whole I think I shan't come home on Sunday.  I must go to opera tomorrow, & there is a function I, <U>must</U> do on Monday afternoon; so it would be almost ridiculous especially as you will be a houseful.  Mary will be telling you what news there is.  It looks as tho F[ran]k were making not steady but even rapid progress!  Mrs Hewitt [<I>Note</I>] has been admitted to see him today.  His sisters have been in to see him without permission ...</p>

 

<p>Isa is of c[our]se rather tried.  I had a tel[e]ph[one] chat with Mary today. –  My dear, how near your going seems!  Yes, I shall of c[our]se go to South[amp]ton, but must be back in time for the Russian ballet at night.  What days I am having!  No chance of a night off for weeks.  I am glad the dr[essing] case pleases.  Nothing like belonging to a big family for excitements!  Isa is getting fed up already with visitors!  – Mary will tell you more than I can.  I have given up my midnight visits to the hospital, & things with me are comparatively normal.  But not at the office – where all are having awful times; Chas doing practically everything.</p>

 

<p>My love!  Richard</p>

 <p>Note: Frank's mother who had remarried on the death of his father.</p>
